    1. About half of the sales are coming in from 20-24 year olds, it seems like this is the sweetspot between an age in which video games are interesting and the customer has disposable income to spend on games.

    3. Final Critic is the best selling and most profitable game, the gaming company should find out what makes this game succesful and emulate it in others.
